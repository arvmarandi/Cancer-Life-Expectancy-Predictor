# Breast Cancer Patient Life Expectancy Classification

This project accomplishes the task of classifying life expectancies for breast cancer patients.

Implementations of KNN, Naive Bayes, and Top Down Induction of Decision Trees (TDIDT) analyze the National Cancer Institute's [SEER Incidence Dataset](https://seer.cancer.gov/data/) to make accurate predictions on a given patient's life expectancy. A corresponding Jupyter Notebook for this task can be found [here](https://github.com/arvmarandi/Cancer-Life-Expectancy-Predictor/blob/main/LifeExpectancy_Classification_BreastCancer_SEER_2010.ipynb).

All associated classifiers and utility functions in this repository have been developed by the author, from scratch.
